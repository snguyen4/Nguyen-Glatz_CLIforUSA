No, you don't have to do this necessarily. Only if you have time. Of course this would be quite advanced. So only do it if you think you have done everthing else you need. By contrast, what you could easily do is to estimate a model where you regress GDP growth on the corresponding indicators and compare which model has the higher R2. This would be an in-sample rather than an out-of-sample evaluation.
